# dart_html_utils

Miscellaneous utility code for Dart for the Web.

This currently is intended to be consumed as a Git submodule and not as a
pub.dev package.

**Do *not* expect API stability**.  Interfaces might change, be moved, or
removed without notice.

I also make no claim to the quality of this code; I am very inexperienced with
web development and don't know what I'm doing.
